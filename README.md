# Personality-Based-Song-Suggestion-AI

This AI project suggests songs based on a person's personality type and mood. The AI has knowledge about eight different factors: Introvert, Extrovert, Intuitive, Observant, Thinking, Feeling, Judging, and Prospecting. It also knows about four different moods: Happy, Sad, Angry, and Calm.

The project contains a set of pre-defined songs for each personality type and mood. These songs are chosen based on their lyrics, genre, and popularity.

The AI works by asking the user about their personality type and mood, and then suggests songs based on their answers. The suggested songs are a combination of the songs related to the user's personality type and the songs related to their mood.
## Usage
To use the AI, simply run the "suggest_songs" predicate in the Prolog interpreter. The AI will ask you to enter your personality type and mood, and then suggest a list of songs for you.

Example usage:
`
suggest_songs.
`
Are you an introvert or extrovert? introvert.
Are you feeling happy, sad, angry, or calm? calm.
Here are some songs for you: 
['Hello', 'Everybody Hurts', 'The Scientist', 'You Raise Me Up', 'Bridge Over Troubled Water', 'How Deep Is Your Love', 'Weightless', 'Electra', 'Mellomaniac (Chillout Mix)', 'The Best Is Yet to Come', 'Colors of the Wind', 'The Way It Is']

The program will then prompt the user to select their preferred platform, genre, and difficulty level. Once the user has provided their preferences, the program will print a list of recommended games that match those preferences.

## Knowledge Base
The knowledge base of this AI project includes pre-defined personality types, moods, and songs. Here is a breakdown of the different factors and their associated songs:

- Personality Types (Introvert, Extrovert, Intuitive, Observant)
- Moods (Happy, Sad, Angry, Calm)

## Future Improvements
This AI project could be improved in a few ways:

   - Adding more personality types and moods to the knowledge base.
   - Expanding the song list for each personality type and mood.
   - Integrating a recommendation system that suggests songs based on the user's listening history.
   - Developing a user interface that makes it easier for non-technical users to interact with the AI.
   - Building a feature that allows users to rate the suggested songs and provide feedback to improve the AI's recommendations.
